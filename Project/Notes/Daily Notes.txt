Setup

Our components are authored with a 1 design unit : 1mm ratio for physical contexts. When you set up a Canvas for use with volumetric UI intended for display in immersive 3D applications:

Ensure your Canvas is worldspace
Ensure the scale of the Canvas is globally 0.001 on all axes



----


I have a scaler that restores scales (100 on all axes)

Cylinder that represents grid lines is 0.05, 10, 0.05

But in RectTransform, we also have width and height. We have a Width of 10 and a Height of 2.

----

The Cylinders right now are 4.5 units apart...but, we will need something closer together.


----


Nope, now Cylinders are 2.5 cm apart, 1 mm thick, 1 m long.

----

For unit vectors, we need to move an object around...but we also need to draw a cylinder & arrow from the origin to that position.

This means war. Or something.

16.5 FOV camera for accurate Hololens test

----

The vector scale right now is:

0.25, ?, 0.25

And cone is:

0.5, ?, 0.5

But I think it could be thicker...0.35? 0.5?
